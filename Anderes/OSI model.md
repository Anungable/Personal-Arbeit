The model partitions the flow of data in a communication system into seven [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer) to describe networked communication from the physical implementation of transmitting bits across a [communications medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium) to the highest-level representation of data of a [distributed application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_application). Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Classes of functionality  are realized in all software development through all standardized [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol).
