1. acro expo值歸0

2. 先acro後altitude

3. acro固定單一姿態看response

4. position調`MPC_POS_MODE`+比對差異

5. altitude下只調`(mc_yaw_P)`, `mc_yaw_rate_P`看效果

6. altitude下調`mc_yawrate_ff`

7. 不打roll看control actuator FFT改善 (roll特別高)

8. filter tuning: 先tune`IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF`

   The performed flight maneuver can simply be hovering in [Manual/Stabilized mode](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/blob/main/en/flight_modes_mc/manual_stabilized.md) with some rolling and pitching to all directions and some increased throttle periods. The total duration does not need to be more than 30 seconds. In order to better compare, the maneuver should be similar in all tests.

   First tune the gyro filter [IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/blob/main/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF) by increasing it in steps of 10 Hz while using a low D-term filter value ([IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/blob/main/en/advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF) = 30). Upload the logs to [Flight Review](https://logs.px4.io) and compare the *Actuator Controls FFT* plot. Set the cutoff frequency to a value before the noise starts to increase noticeably (for frequencies around and above 60 Hz).

9. 低頻濾波用notch filter: `IMU_GYRO_NF0_FRQ`, `IMU_GYRO_NF1_BW`
