### When to Use Each:

1. **Stack:**
   - Use the stack for small, short-lived variables with a known and fixed size.
   - Prefer the stack for local variables within functions.
2. **Heap:**
   - Use the heap for dynamic allocation of memory when the size is not known at compile time.
   - Use the heap for objects with a longer lifetime or when data needs to be shared between different parts of the program.

### Considerations:

1. **Resource Management:**
   - Stack memory is automatically managed by the system, while heap memory requires manual management.
   - Improper management of heap memory can lead to memory leaks or, conversely, premature deallocation.
2. **Performance:**
   - Access to stack memory is usually faster than heap memory due to its fixed and known size.
3. **Thread Safety:**
   - Each thread typically has its own stack, making stack memory inherently thread-safe.
   - Proper synchronization is needed when multiple threads access shared data on the heap.
4. **Overhead:**
   - Dynamic allocation on the heap involves more overhead than allocating on the stack.
